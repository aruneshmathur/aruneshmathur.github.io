<p>I'm interested in problems at the nexus of artificial intelligence, human&ndash;computer interaction, and technology policy, with an emphasis on data privacy and platform regulation.</p>

<p>I completed my PhD in <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/">computer science</a> from Princeton University, where I was affiliated with the <a href="http://citp.princeton.edu">Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP)</a>. My <a href="https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp012f75rc09f">dissertation</a> received the <a href="https://sigchi.org/awards/sigchi-award-recipients/2021-sigchi-awards/" target="_blank">2021 ACM SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award</a>.</p>

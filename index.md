<p><img src="/files/pic_Fotor.png" id="mug-shot" alt="mug-shot" />I'm a postdoctoral research fellow in the <a href="http://citp.princeton.edu">Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP)</a> at <a href="http://princeton.edu">Princeton University</a>. I am supported by a <a href="https://digital-lab.consumerreports.org/fellows/">Consumer Reports fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>I study the societal impacts of digital technologies, with an emphasis on data privacy, consumer protection, and the governance and accountability of data-driven systems.</p>


<p>I graduated with a PhD in <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/">computer science</a> from Princeton University where I was a CITP graduate student fellow. My dissertation received the <a href="https://sigchi.org/awards/sigchi-award-recipients/2021-sigchi-awards/" target="_blank">2021 ACM SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award</a>. I worked with <a href="http://randomwalker.info">Arvind Narayanan</a> and <a href="http://marshini.net">Marshini Chetty</a>.</p>

<p>Much of my recent focus has been on dark pattern user interfaces. I have studied how they manifest in <a href="https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/dark-patterns/" target="_blank">e-commerce websites</a>, <a href="https://electionemails2020.org/" target="_blank">political campaign emails</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00620.pdf" target="_blank">social media</a>. I have also <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3400901" target="_blank">traced their past and outlined where they might be heading in the future</a>.</p>


<p>I recently participated in two public panels about dark patterns organized by Senator Warner's office and the Consumer Federation of America. The video recordings from those events are below.</p>
